# Suggested Game Rules

These are the rules we recommend to ensure a fair and balanced game.

1. If the runners kill the Ender Dragon, they win, but if the hunters kill all of the runners, the hunters win.
2. Runners and hunters must not cross-team.
3. Spectators cannot spy on/ghost a team and tell the other team what they're doing.
4. Don't use hacks or cheats (e.g fly, killaura, speed, etc). Game bugs are allowed to be exploited (e.g boats on lava glitch, scaffolding glitch, etc).
5. Strategies can be created before the game starts.
6. The hunters cannot harm the Ender Dragon.
