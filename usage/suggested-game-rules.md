# Suggested Game Rules

These are the rules we recommend to ensure a fair and balanced game.

Of course, you can tweak these rules or disregard them entirely - I'm not your mom; do what you want.

1. If the runners kill the Ender Dragon, they win, but if the hunters kill all of the runners, the hunters win.
2. Runners and hunters must not cross-team.
3. Spectators cannot spy on/ghost a team and tell the other team what they're doing.
4. Don't use hacks or cheats (e.g fly, killaura, speed, etc). However, game bugs are allowed to be exploited (e.g boats on lava glitch, scaffolding glitch, etc).
5. Strategies in each of the teams can be created before the game starts.
6. The hunters cannot harm the Ender Dragon (this is enforced to some degree by the plugin in its default config - edit the config file to turn this off).
