# Scenarios

Scenarios are twists you can add to your game, to make it more interesting.

There are different types of scenarios:

* All-game: These are always active for the entirety of the game.
* Periodically: These happen every so often, and have one-time effects (e.g. dropping items or spawning mobs)
* Brief periodically: These have effects which last for a short amount of time and happens every so often (e.g. potion effects, disabling player abilities, etc).
* Change periodically: The effects are always active but change every so often (e.g. changing disguises).

These types are not visible in-game other than in the scenario description.
