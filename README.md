# Minecraft Manhunt
A classic take on Dream's manhunt game.
No original source code has been used.

This is in development, but when it's done here's how it'll work:
* Add the runners by typing command: `/manhunt runner <player>`
* Add the hunters by typing command: `/manhunt hunter <player>`
* Start the game by typing command: `/manhunt start`

When the game is started, all other players will be put into spectator and the hunters will be given a compass that they can use to track the nearest runner. When all runners are dead the hunters win but if one of the runners kills the ender dragon the runners win. The runners cannot respawn but the hunters can.
