# Introduction

Manhunt is a game popularised by famous content creator Dream, in which there are two teams: hunters and runners. The runners have to speedrun the game, killing the Ender Dragon, and the hunters have to kill the runners. When a runner dies, they can't respawn, but when a hunter dies, they can. If all runners die, they lose, and if they kill the Ender Dragon, they win.

This plugin is a version of the game built from scratch, without using any code from Dream.
