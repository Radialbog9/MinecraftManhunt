## Introduction
Minecraft Manhunt is a plugin heavily inspired by [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/c/dream)'s Manhunt series.
This plugin emulates the game in that series.

## The Game
These are the only things set in stone. The rest of the rules are up to you. For the recommended rules, check the [rule book](https://radialbog9.github.io/MinecraftManhunt/rulebook).
* The players are split into 2 groups - hunters and runners.
* The hunters have to try and kill all of the runners before the runners defeat the Ender Dragon.
* The hunters can all respawn but the runners only have 1 life.
