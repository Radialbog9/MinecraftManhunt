# API
This plugin has a (sort of) messy API, which doesn't really do anything at all at the moment.

* You can access the Manhunt Variables through the `uk.radialbog9.spigot.manhunt.utils.ManhuntVars` class.
* You can start the game by calling the `uk.radialbog9.spigot.manhunt.game.GameManager.startGame()` method.
* You can end the game by calling the `uk.radialbog9.spigot.manhunt.game.GameManager.endGame()` method.

For more info, look at the [JavaDoc](https://ci.radialbog9.uk/job/MinecraftManhunt/javadoc/).
